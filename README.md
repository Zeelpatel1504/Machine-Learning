# **Cryptocurrency Prediction with Artificial Intelligence V3.0 [GRU Neural Network]**
we are pleased to announce with you the V3.0 of our cryptocurrency prediction project with Machine Learning. We used LSTM in V1.0 and RNN in V2.0. In V3.0, We use the GRU Neural Network, whose algorithms that We have designed ourselves. The artificial intelligence We created managed to achieve 99.54% accuracy in the March 27 BTC Forecast. Scores are; Total params: 104.658.433, MAE score: 0.02262356696266076, MSE score: 0.0008216340443992631, Accuracy: 98.5220357283052. Another element that We developed in the project is that We wrote algorithm code to visualize neural networks so that people can understand the GRU structure. Everything happens automatically. We are happy to share the project as open source.
